    "# Interval Scheduling Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The interval scheduling problem (also known as the activity\n",
    "selection problem) is that of choosing the optimal subset $P^{\\ast}$ of a set $P = \\{0, . . . , N − 1\\}$ of N processes (or activities) to be executed on a single processor, each process i having a specified interval $(s_i,t_i)$, consisting of a start time $s_i$ and a termination time $t_i$, during which process $i$ is eligible to execute, and also having a weight $w_i$ that is the profit gained if this eligible process is scheduled (selected) for processing. Since there is a single processor, the intervals of the selected processes cannot overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem can be solved using the nonserial functional equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(p,q) = \\max \\limits_{d \\in P} \\{f(p, s_d) + c(d|p, q) + f(t_d,q)\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $c(d|p, q) = w_d$ if d is “eligible”, i.e. $p \\le s_d$ and $t_d \\le q$; else $c(d|p, q) = 0$.\n",
    "The goal is to solve for $f(0,T)$ given the base cases $f(p, q) = 0$ for $p \\ge q$, where $T ≥ max_i\\{t_i\\}$."

    "\n",
    "For $T = 20$, the goal is $f(0,20) = 8$, where the optimal decisions are to select processes 1, 3, and 5 to be included in $P^{\\ast}$.\n",
