# Dynamic Programming Problems

In this repository are several notebooks made with Python 3 in Jupyter.
They correspond to some studies on dynamic programming.
Many of the solutions can be found in the book:

LEW, Art; MAUCH, Holger. __Dynamic programming: A computational tool__. Springer, 2006.

## Strings and Sequences

O diretorio "Sequences" contem alguns notebooks em jupyter que tratam de problems de obter a maior sequencia ou a maior substring comum a duas strings.
